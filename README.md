GitHub Platform Tutorial Repository

Hello! 

My name is Jean and I would like to learn more about programming in different languages, using code to structure interesting projects and computer and/or data science in general. I plan to use GitHub as my central platform for me to practice, learn and create my own programs.

Cheers!
Jean.
